Hi! I'm Michael, I started coding back in 2019 and have loved every second of it.

Currenctly I'm learning more about Web Development than anything else, but I'm always up for a challenge!

I don't have much experience collaborating with others but I'd love to have the opportunity and would give it my full attention.

You can Reach me through through email at mike_0180@hotmail.com

Thanks.
